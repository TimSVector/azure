<p><strong>Basic Test Case Construction</strong></p>
<p>Basic test case construction is covered, including input and expected values for scalar and structure types. The test cases that you build as part of the <i>Interactive Tutorials </i> are named (CL)MANAGER::PLACEORDER.001 and (CL)MANAGER::PLACE_ORDER.002.
